# view-content-hook-on-category
Award point for content author. The point will be awarded based on these circumstances :
1. When member view the published post
2. Categories taxonomy

The feature I want in the custom hook is :
1. Limit settings
2. Hook option base on category
3. Connect with badges (able to automaticcaly given by specific actions

Example :
John is a content author. Already post 2 content. One in category Lifestyle, another on category Funny.
Jane is viewing both of John content. Therefore John gets 1 point on category Lifestyle & 1 point on category Funny (Instead of getting 2 point for viewing John content)
